It's our mission to raise awareness about this form of cancer and to continue to engage in the philanthropic activities that were important to her. Our foundation provides Art Scholarships to graduating seniors at several schools in the Hudson Valley, supports local Humane Societies, makes donations to organizations for the developmentally challenged and Ocular Melanoma. There is SO much more to our story that we would love to share with you."
